# Electric_Production_Forecasting

This project is an univariate analysis for an electric production series. The objective is to predict 

Requirements:

```pandas:``` Data analysis and manipulation tool.

```matplotlib:``` Visualization library.

```seaborn:``` Data visualization library based on matplotlib, it enhances the style of matplotlib plots.

```Numpy:``` Numerical analysis library.

```scikit-learn:``` Machine Learning library.

```pmdarima:``` Statistical library for time series analysis in Python.

```darts:``` Python library for easy manipulation and forecasting of time series.

```prophet:``` Prophet is a forecasting procedure implemented in R and Python.

```statsmodels:``` Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of different statistical models.


### FIRST PART: 
Time series analysis, checking stationarity, transforming into stationary.



### SECOND PART | Arima model and Prophet:

### THIRD PART | Darts models: 
Darts embeds most of the widely used time series forecasting methods, its primary goal is to simplify the whole time series machine learning experience. 
In this part, a single function is used to fit the data, predict future observations, evaluate the model and plot the results. 
Several models have been tested using this function.
